<p><b>Disclaimers</b><br>APPLE DOES NOT PROMISE THAT THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT, SERVICE OR FEATURE OF THE SITE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE WILL PROVIDE SPECIFIC RESULTS.  THE SITE AND ITS CONTENT ARE DELIVERED ON AN &#147;AS-IS&#148; AND &#147;AS-AVAILABLE&#148; BASIS.  ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE SITE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.  APPLE CANNOT ENSURE THAT ANY FILES OR OTHER DATA YOU DOWNLOAD FROM THE SITE WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES.  APPLE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  APPLE DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR THE ACTS, OMISSIONS AND CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND/OR ANY APPLE SERVICES.

YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST APPLE FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT IS TO STOP USING THE SITE OR ANY SUCH CONTENT.  THIS LIMITATION OF RELIEF IS A PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>
<p>The above disclaimer applies to any damages, liability or injuries caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction of or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use, whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence or any other cause of action.</p>
<p>Apple reserves the right to do any of the following, at any time, without notice: (1) to modify, suspend or terminate operation of or access to the Site, or any portion of the Site, for any reason; (2) to modify or change the Site, or any portion of the Site, and any applicable policies or terms; and (3) to interrupt the operation of the Site, or any portion of the Site, as necessary to perform routine or non-routine maintenance, error correction, or other changes.</p>

<p><b>Limitation of Liability</b><br>Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Apple be liable to you for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if Apple has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, Apple is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or any Content, Apple&#146;s liability shall in no event exceed the greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar fees with respect to any service or feature of or on the Site paid in the six months prior to the date of the initial claim made against Apple (but not including the purchase price for any Apple hardware or software products or any AppleCare or similar support program), or (2) US$100.00.  Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</p>

<p><b>Indemnity</b><br>You agree to indemnify and hold Apple, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), made against Apple by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.</p>

<p><b>Violation of These Terms of Use</b><br>Apple may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Apple&#146;s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Apple&#146;s customers.  Apple reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Apple deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.  Apple also may disclose your information when Apple determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Apple may preserve any transmittal or communication by you with Apple through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Apple determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Apple, its employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and the public.</p>
<p>You agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future access to the Site if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements or guidelines which may be associated with your use of the Site.  You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Apple, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Apple obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Apple deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances.  These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Apple may have at law or in equity.</p>
<p>You agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems.</p>
<p>If Apple does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms of Use, Apple will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Apple.  You agree that Apple will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of any violation of these Terms of Use.</p>

<p><b>Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</b><br>You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.  You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union.  If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside.  Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.  Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation.  No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys&#146; fees.  In the event of any controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute.  If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation.  If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.</p>

<p><b>Void Where Prohibited</b><br>Apple administers and operates the www.apple.com Site from its location in Cupertino, California USA; other Apple sites may be administered and operated from various locations outside the United States.  Although the Site is accessible worldwide, not all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations, or appropriate or available for use outside the United States.  Apple reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product or service to any person or geographic area.  Any offer for any feature, product or service made on the Site is void where prohibited.  If you choose to access the Site from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws.</p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous</b><br>You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of such Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export laws and regulations.</p>
<p>If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.  These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Apple with regard to your use of the Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between you and Apple with respect to such use are hereby superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you enter into with Apple, Apple will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected.  Apple&#146;s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver by Apple of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Apple and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use.  These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.</p>
<p>Apple provides access to Apple international data and, therefore, may contain references or cross references to Apple products, programs and services that are not announced in your country. Such reference does not imply that Apple in your country intends to announce such products, programs or services.</p>

<p><b>Feedback and Information</b><br>Any feedback you provide at this site shall be deemed to be non-confidential.  Apple shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis.</p>
